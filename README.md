### Projects and references from college classes
## [Advanced Computer Graphics](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/AdvancedComputerGraphics)
   Unity Shader that simulates water ripples formed upon impact of a sphere with the water plane surface. WebGL        lighting simulator using three shading methods to illuminate a 3D object.
   
## [Capstone Game Project](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/CapstoneGameProject)
   Senior Game Project developed in a team of 6 in Unity. Multiplayer Arcade game with full Xbox 360 Controller support and   original art and sound assets. Game developed under industry mentorship.
  
## [Computer Graphics](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/ComputerGraphics)
   C++ implementations of a Restricted OpenGL Library (fewer functions), Phong Illumination model and a Vertex and Fragment shader for shading and texture mapping.
    
## [Computer Music Programming](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/ComputerMusicProgramming)
   Includes a Max Patch to play algorithmically composed pieces, create a dubstep "wobble bass" using multiple control functions, midi synthesizer, and basic sampler that binds samples to keyboard keys. Includes applications using the Javascript Web Audio API that demonstrate amplitude modulation, noise generation based on random values and timing in audio.
   
## [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/DataStructures%26Algorithms)
