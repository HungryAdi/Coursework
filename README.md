# Coursework
### Projects and references from college classes
## [Advanced Computer Graphics](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/AdvancedComputerGraphics)
    Includes: Unity Shader that simulates water ripples formed upon impact of a sphere with the water plane surface. WebGL        lighting simulator using three shading methods to illuminate a 3D object.
   
## [Capstone Game Project](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/CapstoneGameProject)
   Senior Game Project developed in a team of 6 in Unity. Multiplayer Arcade game with full Xbox 360 Controller support and original art and sound assets. Game developed under industry mentorship.

 * Assignment 2: Restricted OpenGL Library
   - The goal is to compute all transform matrices with own implementation of the OpenGL Library. C++ functions written are      found in i_my_gl.cpp/i_my_gl.h
    
 * Assignment 3: Lighting Implementation
   - Implement the Phong Illumination model by calculating the color at each vertex of a surface with the OpenGl Lighting        equation.
    
 * Assignment 4: Vertex & Fragment Shader
   - Vertex Shader to calculate the color at every surface vertex according to Gouaraud and Phong shading models. The            fragment shader assigns texture coordinates to each vertex to implement texture mapping.
    
## [Computer Music Programming](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/ComputerMusicProgramming)
 * Algorithmic Composition 
   - Patch built in Max:MSP that plays two algorithmically composed pieces. The first piece consists of midi-events              triggered at scheduled intervals while the second piece demonstrates generative music as different samples are                introduced as the music evolves.
      
 * Amp Modulation: Amplitude Modulation
   - Contains a Web Audio application and Max patch that demonstrate amplitude modulation. The former consists of a slider       that controls the amplitude of a constant sine wave while the Max patch consists of a DAC that can be turned on/off
  
 * Control Functions
   - Max patch that demonstrates multiple control functions through a dubstep "wobble bass" synthesizer. Heavy frequency and      amplitude modualtion create the "wobble effect" and I extended the synth to change the Q factor and wobble rate to random      values after each time the synth is played.
   
 * Midi Synthesizer
   - Max patch of a midi synthesizer that accepts midi notes from a keyboard or the virtual keyboard in the patch. Contains an    ADSR envelope that can be used to shape the sound.
   
 * Randomness (Noise)
   - Web Audio script to create three types of noise (white, pink and brown) based on random values across the audible            frequency range.
   
 * Sample Trigger
   - This Max Patch is a simplified midi-keyboard that has drum-kit samples bound to specific keys. Press the given keys on      the computer keyboard to play the drums.
   
 * Timed Sonic Events
   - Used Web Audio API to generate three notes that play in ascending order at specific time intervals.
