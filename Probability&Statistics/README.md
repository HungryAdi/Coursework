All code written in Python, written solution to problems contained in jupyter notebooks as well

* Homework 2: Expectation and Conditonal Independence
  - Contains problems regarding the topics above^^
  - Python program to construct a Bayes Classifier with a posterior probability distribution given conditonal probability distribution.
  
* Homework 3: Expectation and Empirical Distributions
  - Contains problems regarding the topics above^^
  - Python program that determines if two random variables are independent given the empirical distributions of random variables: 1) the waiting time between geyser eruptions 2) the duration of an eruption

* Homework 5: Normal Distributions and Regression
  - Contains problems regarding the topics above^^
