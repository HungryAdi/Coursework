## [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/DataStructures%26Algorithms)
### All programs written in C++
  * Quiz 1: Linked List Remove Pairs
   - Iterative and Recursive Functions that take a linked list as a parameter. The functions remove any duplicate pairs of values contained in the list while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.
  
  * Quiz 6: Sorting Methods
   - Selection Sort: O(n^2) sorting algorithm written to sort the values of a linked list by changing node values rather than the order of nodes.
  
  * Course Library
   - Library containing data structures and testing harnesses used in class quizzes and programming assignments.
  
  * Google Test Library
   - Version of the Google C++ Testing Library used to run tests on class assignments.
  
  * Program 1: ICS 46 Template Library
   - Reachability: Prompt the user to enter the name of a file representing a graph. Read the information in the file, storing the graph in a map. Print the graph. Repeatedly prompt the user for a starting node in the graph, and compute and print all the nodes that are reachable from it by following zero or more edges in the graph (e.g., a node is reachable from itself)
   - Instant Runoff Voting: Prompt user to enter the name of a file representing the candidate preferences of a sequence of voters. Read the information in the file, storing it in a Map. Print the voter preferences. Repeatedly display the vote count for ballots (sorted both by candidate and numerically), eliminating from the election the candidate(s) receiving the fewest votes, until one candidate (the winner) or no candidates (a tie) remain.
   - Finite Automata: Prompt the user to enter the name of a file representing a finite automaton: indicating its states and transitions (each transition out of a state specifies the input and the new state). Read the information in the file, storing it in a Map. Print the finite automaton. Prompt the user to enter the name of a file storing the start-state and inputs to process (each line in the file contains this combination). Repeatedly process these lines computing the results of the finite automaton on each input, and then display a trace of the results.
   - Non-Deterministic Finite Automata: Program that solves for a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton the same problem that was solved for a Deterministic Finite Automaton in Problem #3 (above).
   - Word Generator: Prompt the user to enter the order statistic (a positive number) and the name of a file of text. Read the file of text, storing a special corpus in a Map. Print the corpus Map. Prompt the user to enter the order statistic number of words, and the number of random words to generate, then print the original words followed by the words randomly generated from the corpus.
