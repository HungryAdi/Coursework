## [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/HungryAdi/Coursework/tree/master/DataStructures%26Algorithms)
### All programs written in C++
  * Quiz 1: Linked List Remove Pairs
  		- Iterative and Recursive Functions that take a linked list as a parameter. The functions remove any duplicate pairs of values contained in the list while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.
  
  * Quiz 6: Sorting Methods
    - Selection Sort: O(n^2) sorting algorithm written to sort the values of a linked list by changing node values rather than the order of nodes.
  
  * Course Library
    - Library containing data structures and testing harnesses used in class quizzes and programming assignments.
  
  * Google Test Library
    - Version of the Google C++ Testing Library used to run tests on class assignments.
  
  * Program 1: ICS 46 Template Library
    - Reachability: Store information from a file representing a graph into a map, and compute all the nodes that are reachable from it by following edges in the graph.
    - Instant Runoff Voting: Store information from a file representing the candidate preferences of voters and store it in a Map. Display the vote count for ballots eliminating from the election the candidates receiving the fewest votes, until a winner or a tie remains.
    - Finite Automata: Read the information describing a finite automaton and store it in a Map. Prompt the user to enter the name of a file storing the start-state and inputs to process and compute the results of the finite automaton on each input, and then display a trace of the results.
    - Non-Deterministic Finite Automata: Program that solves for a Non-Deterministic Finite Automaton the same problem that was solved for a Deterministic Finite Automaton in the above problem.
    - Word Generator: Given a word order statistic and a file containing text, store the corpus of words in a Map. Prompt the user to enter the number of random words to generate, and randomly generate words from the corpus.
  
  * Program 2: Implement Queue, Priority Queue and Set (and Iterators) with Linked Lists
  	- Queue: Implement with a linear linked list and two instance variables that refer to the front and back of the list. Track the size of the list with a variable so traversal is not required.
   - Priority Queue: Supply the queue with a "greater than" function to determine the priority of an object relative to another and a header node that points to the front of the list. Track the size of the list with a variable so traversal is not required.
 		- Set: Implement with a trailer linked list that contains a trailer node that points to the back of the list. Track the size of the list with a variable so traversal is not required.
    
 * Program 3: Implement Priority Queue and Map (and Iterators) with Binary Trees
