 * Assignment 2: Restricted OpenGL Library
   - The goal is to compute all transform matrices with own implementation of the OpenGL Library. C++ functions written are      found in i_my_gl.cpp/i_my_gl.h
    
 * Assignment 3: Lighting Implementation
   - Implement the Phong Illumination model by calculating the color at each vertex of a surface with the OpenGl Lighting        equation.
    
 * Assignment 4: Vertex & Fragment Shader
   - Vertex Shader to calculate the color at every surface vertex according to Gouaraud and Phong shading models. The            fragment shader assigns texture coordinates to each vertex to implement texture mapping.
