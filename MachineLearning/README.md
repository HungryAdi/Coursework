## Machine Learning
### All Programs written in Python and use Numpy and Matplotlib

* Homework 1: Data Analysis and Jupyter Notebooks
  - Load iris data into numpy and seperate into targets and features. Plot histograms for each feature.
  - Split the data into training and validation sets and perform Knn Classification.
  - Perform Naive Bayes Classification on a given table of target and feature values.
  
* Homework 2: Linear Regression and Cross Validation
  - Create and plot a linear regression predictor based on the iris dataset. Calculate the MSE of the predictions.
  - Fit the target to a polynomial function of increasing order and plot the log training errors to determine the optimal polynomial degree.
  - Perform nFold Cross Validation using the linear regression predictor and determine the optimal number of folds.
  
* Homework 3: Logistic Regression and Shattering
  - Create a logistic classifier specialized to binary classification (trained on the iris dataset). Train the classifier on both linearly separable and non-separable data.
  - Implement the train() function of the classifier with stochastic gradient descent on the logistic loss function.
  - Given a plotted dataset, determine if the data is shatterable or not by a given predictor.
  
* Homework 5: Clustering and Principal Component Analysis
  - Run and plot the following clustering algorithms using the iris dataset: K-means Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering (using single and complete linkage).
  - Given a dataset of greyscale images of faces, perform PCA and reconstruct faces given the multiple number of principal directions.
