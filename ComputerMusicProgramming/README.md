 * Algorithmic Composition 
   - Patch built in Max:MSP that plays two algorithmically composed pieces. The first piece consists of midi-events              triggered at scheduled intervals while the second piece demonstrates generative music as different samples are                introduced as the music evolves.
      
 * Amp Modulation: Amplitude Modulation
   - Contains a Web Audio application and Max patch that demonstrate amplitude modulation. The former consists of a slider       that controls the amplitude of a constant sine wave while the Max patch consists of a DAC that can be turned on/off
  
 * Control Functions
   - Max patch that demonstrates multiple control functions through a dubstep "wobble bass" synthesizer. Heavy frequency and      amplitude modualtion create the "wobble effect" and I extended the synth to change the Q factor and wobble rate to random      values after each time the synth is played.
   
 * Midi Synthesizer
   - Max patch of a midi synthesizer that accepts midi notes from a keyboard or the virtual keyboard in the patch. Contains an    ADSR envelope that can be used to shape the sound.
   
 * Randomness (Noise)
   - Web Audio script to create three types of noise (white, pink and brown) based on random values across the audible            frequency range.
   
 * Sample Trigger
   - This Max Patch is a simplified midi-keyboard that has drum-kit samples bound to specific keys. Press the given keys on      the computer keyboard to play the drums.
   
 * Timed Sonic Events
   - Used Web Audio API to generate three notes that play in ascending order at specific time intervals.
