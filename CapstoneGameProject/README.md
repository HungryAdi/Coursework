'Blobcano' is my Senior Game Project developed with a team of 6 in Unity. It is a Multiplayer Arcade game with full Xbox 360 Controller support and original art and sound assets. Over the course of two quarters (One quarter completed) my team will create a feature complete game under the guidance of mentors in the industry (Blizzard and Amazon Game Studios).
